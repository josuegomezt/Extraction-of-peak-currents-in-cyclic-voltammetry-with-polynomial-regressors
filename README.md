# Extraction-of-peak-currents-in-cyclic-voltammetry-with-polynomial-regressors
This repository hosts a project that automates the extraction of baseline lines for calculating peak currents in the anodic and cathodic sweeps of cyclic voltammetry in electrochemistry, using polynomial regressions with scikit-learn.
